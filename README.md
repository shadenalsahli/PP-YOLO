# PP-YOLO

PP-YOLO is an object detector that based on YOLOv3. It is called PP-YOLO since the authors conducted all experiments based on PaddlePaddle, a Parallel Distributed Deep Learning framework.
I did not build the code from scratch; I used <a href="https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleDetection">PaddleDetection</a> as a reference.

## Dataset

I trained the model on the <a href="https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/bccd">BCCD dataset</a>, which has three classes: WBC (white blood cells), RBC (red blood cells), and Platelets.
